##1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```groovy
(1..999).findAll{it%3==0 || it%5==0}.sum()
```
##2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</br>
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```groovy
f = {a,b,c,s,n-> c==n-1 ? [a, b, s] : f(b, a+b, ++c, s+","+(a+b), n)}
f(1,2,1,"1,2", 10)[2].split(",").collect{ it as Long }.findAll{ it%2==0 }.sum()
```
##3 - Largest prime factor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.<br/>
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```groovy
BigInteger n = 600851475143
acc = []

for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++){
    while(n%i == 0) {
        acc << i
        n /= i
    }
}
acc.max()
```

##4 - Largest palindrome product
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.<br/>
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```groovy
def isPl(n){s=n.length(); return  s%2==0 ? n[0..(s/2-1)] == n[-1..s/2] : n[0..(s/2-1)] == n[-1..s/2+1]   }
a=999
pl = [:]
acc = []
notFound = true
while(a>=100 && notFound){
    for(b=999 ; b>=100; b--){
        acc << [a, b, a*b, isPl( (a*b).toString() )]
        if(isPl( (a*b).toString() )) {pl << [(a*b):[a,b]]}
    }
    a--
}

println pl.sort{ it.key }
```

##5 - Smallest multiple
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.<br/>

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```groovy
def gcd(int a, int b){
    while(b){
        (a, b) = [b, a%b]
    }
    return a
}

def lcm(int a, int b){
    int temp = gcd(a,b)
    return temp ? a/temp*b : 0
}

int answer = 1
1.upto(21){answer = lcm(answer, it)}
```
