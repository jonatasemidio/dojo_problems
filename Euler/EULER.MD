##1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```groovy
(1..999).findAll{it%3==0 || it%5==0}.sum()
```
##2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</br>
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```groovy
f = {a,b,c,s,n-> c==n-1 ? [a, b, s] : f(b, a+b, ++c, s+","+(a+b), n)}
f(1,2,1,"1,2", 10)[2].split(",").collect{ it as Long }.findAll{ it%2==0 }.sum()
```
##3 - Largest prime factor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.<br/>
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```groovy
BigInteger n = 600851475143
acc = []

for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++){
    while(n%i == 0) {
        acc << i
        n /= i
    }
}
acc.max()
```
